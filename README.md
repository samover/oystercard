# Makers Academy: Oystercard

## Introduction:

There is one class in this project:
  Oystercard.

  Oystercard contains the following methods:

    *top_up
    *deduct
    *`balance`
    *`in_journey`
    *`touch_in`
    *`touch_out`


## Challenge 09:
  `touch_in` will fail if balance is below the `MINIMUM_FARE` (1£)

## Challenge 10:
  `touch_out` will trigger `deduct`ion of `MINIMUM_FARE`
  `deduct` method is passive and can therefore be made private.
  Unit test involving `deduct` needs updating to reflect that.
